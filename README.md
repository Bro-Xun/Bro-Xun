Hi, no matter who, where, how you are, nice to meet you while I am still alive.

I am Bro-Xun, a student in NanKing, PRC. (2022/03)

I have decided to be a IT developer or biologist. But now it just seems to be **impossible**[^1].

As you may know, I'd like to be a trans:rainbow_flag:. But they are treated badly by most citizens in PRC, I'm afraid of killed because of that[^2]. But I am really eager to be a normal little girl[^3]. That may be seriously danger in PRC.

### Contact me

Welcome to contact me! If you are also a (pre)transgender:transgender_flag: living in PRC, it will be wonderful if we can support each other.:kissing_heart:

Well, I tried this to hide something to protect my self. But it turned out that I cannot use JavaScript or CSS here. I feel unable to understand it.:thinking:
```html
<span class="heimu">45</span>
<style>
  .heimu{
    color:#222;
    background-color:#222;
  }
  .heimu:hover{
    color:#eee;
  }
</style>
<script>
  var bb = document.getElementsByClassName("heimu");
  if (bb.length != 0){
    for (var i = 0;i < bb.length;i++){
        bb[i].title = "you know too much";
    }
  }
</script>
```

[^1]:I don't want to say a single word on it, to put it in Chinese(2022/zh-CN): `ÊáÇÂæóÈÉΩÊáÇ`. If you have friends in PRC, asking makes questions solved.
[^2]:I really feel sorry to hear that. Wish everything goes well with her. [About it.(Maybe it is banned by GFW in PRC, since I haven't tried it without proxy.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/tb0sen/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%A4%A9%E8%A1%97%E5%8F%91%E7%94%9F%E6%9D%80%E4%BA%BA%E6%A1%88%E7%96%91%E4%BC%BC%E6%98%AF%E5%AF%B9%E8%B7%A8%E6%80%A7%E5%88%AB%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%87%E6%81%A8%E7%8A%AF%E7%BD%AA%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E8%AF%9D%E9%A2%98%E5%92%8C%E5%BE%AE%E5%8D%9A%E6%AD%A3%E8%A2%AB%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E5%88%A0%E9%99%A4/) If it doesn't work, then [**Try this**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/479043103).
[^3]:However, many teenage born-boys in PRC claim that they have such sort of thoughts. But from my point of view, they are even unable to accept that they should give up the iconic organ of male
[^4]:Now my target country is Singapore:singapore: (Taiwan (Region):taiwan: is also OK (in PRC you can't call it a country, just a PRC-TW, `‰∏≠ÂõΩÂè∞Êπæ` in Chinese(2022/zh-CN))), while I don't really know how it is. But according to the information I have currently, it is livable. And, however, no matter how it is, IT WON'T BE WORSE THAN THAT RIGHT HERE.
[^5]:To contribute to AquaSun Chemcial Industry Group (NanKing).:warning: :rofl:
