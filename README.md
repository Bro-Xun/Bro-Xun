### About me

Hi, no matter who, where, how you are, nice to meet you while I am still alive.

I am Bro-Xun, a student in NanKing, PRC. (2022/03)

I have decided to be a IT developer or biologist. But now it just seems to be **impossible**[^1].

As you may know, I'd like to be a trans:rainbow_flag::transgender_symbol:. But they are treated badly by most citizens in PRC, I'm afraid of killed because of that[^2]. But I am really eager to be a normal little girl[^3]. That may be seriously danger in PRC.

### My hobbies
- Coding:desktop_computer:	
  - Because of some reason, I don't make any substantial progress in it. But I really love it!
- Chemistry:test_tube:
  - I really love it
- `整活`(I don't know how to put it in English...)
  - It's really fun!
    - [Here's one of my work.](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bro-Xun/sources@main/downloads/%E5%A4%A7%E6%B5%B7%E8%88%AA%E8%A1%8C%E9%9D%A0%E8%88%B5%E6%89%8B%20-%20%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%80%E7%89%88.pdf)
- Music:musical_note:
  - I quite like Pure Music & English Music.
  - Here is my favourite Chinese music
    - [OffWall - Namewee](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bro-Xun/sources@main/downloads/%E5%A2%99%E5%A4%96.mp3)
    - [The Great Citizen - Zhihua Zheng(MPEG4-File)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bro-Xun/sources@main/websites/tgc-zipped.mp4)
  - Internationale is also good, but I didn't upload it to my CDN.
- \*\*\*:hammer:
  - Since I don't want to be made to be disappear, I choose to hide this item.

### As the end
If you see this, thank you for your patience. It's really kind of you to make it.

Now share some lyrics excerpted from `杀死那个石家庄人`, a chinese music which I think as `The Best Chinese Music of The Past 2 Years(2020-2021)`

> 如此生活三十年
> 
> 直到大厦崩塌
> 
> 底层[^6]深处的黑暗啊
> 
> 淹没心底的景观

Well, I tried this to hide something to protect my self. But it turned out that I cannot use JavaScript or CSS here. I feel unable to understand it.:thinking:
```html
<span class="heimu">45</span>
<style>
  .heimu{
    color:#222;
    background-color:#222;
  }
  .heimu:hover{
    color:#eee;
  }
</style>
<script>
  var bb = document.getElementsByClassName("heimu");
  if (bb.length != 0){
    for (var i = 0;i < bb.length;i++){
        bb[i].title = "you know too much";
    }
  }
</script>
```

**Annotation**
[^1]:I don't want to say a single word on it, to put it in Chinese(2022/zh-CN): `懂得都懂`. If you have friends in PRC, asking makes questions solved.
[^2]:I really feel sorry to hear that. Wish everything goes well with her. [About it.(Maybe it is banned by GFW in PRC, since I haven't tried it without proxy.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/tb0sen/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%A4%A9%E8%A1%97%E5%8F%91%E7%94%9F%E6%9D%80%E4%BA%BA%E6%A1%88%E7%96%91%E4%BC%BC%E6%98%AF%E5%AF%B9%E8%B7%A8%E6%80%A7%E5%88%AB%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%87%E6%81%A8%E7%8A%AF%E7%BD%AA%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E8%AF%9D%E9%A2%98%E5%92%8C%E5%BE%AE%E5%8D%9A%E6%AD%A3%E8%A2%AB%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E5%88%A0%E9%99%A4/) If it doesn't work, then [**Try this**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/479043103).
[^3]:However, many teenage born-boys in PRC claim that they have such sort of thoughts. But from my point of view, they are even unable to accept that they should give up the iconic organ of male
[^4]:Now my target country is Singapore:singapore: (Taiwan (Region):taiwan: is also OK (in PRC you can't call it a country, just a PRC-TW, `中国台湾` in Chinese(2022/zh-CN))), while I don't really know how it is. But according to the information I have currently, it is livable. And, however, no matter how it is, IT WON'T BE WORSE THAN THAT RIGHT HERE.
[^5]:To contribute to AquaSun Chemcial Industry Group (NanKing).:warning: :rofl:
[^6]:It is `云层深处的黑暗` in original lyric, but I think `底层深处的黑暗` makes a deeper topic.
